Congratulations! You're smart.

All github.io pages have a predictable github public repository, and here you are.

This is a fake phishing page, and you tracked it !

Please DM me (Sergio) so I can count how many people missed it.

Also do not announce it in any public channel so everybody can enjoy this.
